## What Is the Yi Radical Qot?

The character **꒐** is known as **Yi Radical Qot**, representing one of the **55 official Yi radicals**. These radicals serve as the core components of the **Nuosu Yi syllabary**, which was standardized in the 1970s based on the Liangshan dialect. Qot itself does **not stand alone as a word** but is used in **compound syllables** and helps form more complex characters.

* **Phonetic value:** /qoʔ/ or /qot/
* In Yi linguistics, this sound approximates a **glottalized or voiceless uvular stop**, which is rare in many global languages but central to Yi pronunciation.

## Yi Script and Its Structure

The **Yi script** is a syllabary consisting of **over 800 basic characters**, each representing a syllable.

* Yi radicals function much like **bushou** in Chinese, helping to categorize and sort characters.
* **Qot (꒐)** appears in several syllabic characters, especially those beginning with a **"qo-"** sound.

* **Digital preservation** of Yi literature
* **Software localization** for Yi-speaking populations
